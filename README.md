## 🌟 Introduction

**Upaay Dashboard** - This React project is a Kanban-style dashboard modeled on a Figma design, letting users add, move, and filter tasks. It uses Redux for state management and persists data with Local Storage. Features include pixel-perfect UI, sectioned task boards ("To Do", "In Progress", "Done"), filtering by category or priority, and optional drag-and-drop movement. Each component can be styled using Tailwind CSS for a modern interface. The app is deployable and ready for real-world use.
